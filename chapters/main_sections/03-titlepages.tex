  This project aims to analyze how to choose a model that best describes a given dataset through likelihood theory, multiple linear regression and hypotheses testing along with cross validation.
  The importance of being able to predict future observations based upon given variables has lead to the following statement of intent.\\
  
  \textit{Under which conditions is the Maximum-Likelihood estimator equal to the Ordinary-Least-Squares estimator? How can $F$-tests and cross-validation be used to formulate a statistical model based on the HOME dataset? What are the characteristics of the two methods in the context of prediction?}\\
  
  The project gives useful information and methods to find the best linear unbiased estimator and also considers the trade-off between bias and variance in the model using basic properties in maximum likelihood theory and methods such as $F$-tests and cross-validation.\\
  
  In conclusion the project found that $F$-tests, compared to cross-validation, tends to give an overfitted model with less bias and $5$-fold cross-validations tends to give a model with more bias but no overfitting.
